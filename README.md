# epResponsive

The epResponsive plug-in allows columns to be hidden as the window is resized, using metadata-defined column widths for the column definitions.

# Installation

Install using bower

# Usage

Include the feature letter `R` on the dom option. An array of the column definitions should be pushed to the datatables settings object, named `columns`. Each column in the array should
have a width defined in em units in a string (e.g. "10em").
